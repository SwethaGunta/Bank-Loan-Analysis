# Bank-Loan-Analysis

**OVERVIEW**

1. It aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their instalments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

2. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.

**DATASET**

The dataset contains the following files:
1. `application_data.csv` contains all the information of the client at the time of application. The data is about wheather a client has payment difficulties.
2. `previous_application.csv` contains information about the clientâ€™s previous loan data. It contains the data whether the previous application had been Approved, Cancelled, Refused or Unused offer.
3. `columns_descrption.csv` is data dictionary which describes the meaning of the variables.

**APPROACH**

1. _Step 1_: Loading the data, and removing unwanted columns.
2. _Step 2_: Imputing the missing data with appropriate method.
3. _Step 3_: Checking for any remaining missing values in both the data sets.
4. _Step 4_: Data Set ready for Analysis.

**RESULT**

1. As a Data Analyst, we have mined insights on which type of people should be awarded the loans and who should not be given
2. There is high correlation between Amt_Credit and Amt_Annuity and AmtGoodsPrice.
3. We also see that female with Cash Loans and having 2 children with Amount Credit of 2L-3L are highest defaulters.
4. The data imbalance is shown using pie charts.
5. In the process of solving this project, I learnt show casing the data using different charts of seaborn, using correlation maps, finding relation and dependency between different features, univariate analysis, segmented univariate analysis, bivariate analysis.
